This API defines two possible types of comparisons, 1-1 and 1-many or 1-N.
These are represented by the [janice_verify](functions.md#JaniceVerify) and
[janice_search](functions.md#JaniceSearch) functions respectively. The API
quantified the relationship between two templates as a single number called a
similarity score. The definition of a similarity score in the context of this
API is discussed [here](functions.md#JaniceVerifySimilarityScore).
