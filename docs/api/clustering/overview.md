This API defines clustering is the automatic and unsupervised combination of
unlabelled templates into groups of like templates. What constitutes likeness
is heavily dependent on the use case and context in question. One example when
dealing with faces is grouping based on identity, where all faces belonging to
a single individual are placed in a cluster.
